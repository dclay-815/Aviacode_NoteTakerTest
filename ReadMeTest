1) Change the application so that every distinct user who logs in has access to only their own notes.

2) Allow users to apply arbitrary tags to each note and to filter the main list of notes by a selected tag.

3) Add a search feature.

4) Match the visual style of www.aviacode.com as if this website were to become part of that site.

5) Introduce a unit-testing project and implement unit tests.
